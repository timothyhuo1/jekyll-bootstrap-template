    <h3>Location: Hilton Hawaiian Village</h3>
    <p>
      A celebration of Hawaii's cultural diversity and natural environment, Aloha Bowls and Tea's parent company was founded in Maui in 2015.
      We strive to serve healthy and high-quality food and beverage products to our guests with Aloha.
      Being a local small business, we value the concept of Ohana, we source our ingredients locally as available.
      We utilize only fresh sashimi-grade Ahi from the Pacific Fish Auction here in Honolulu for our fresh Poke Bowls.
      Smoothies are made from fresh and real fruits, and our teas are brewed multiple times through the day.
      All drinks and bowls are made to order to ensure our guests enjoy the freshest local favorites.
